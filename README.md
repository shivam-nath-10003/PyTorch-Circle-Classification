# PyTorch-Circle-Classification

This Jupyter Notebook implements a binary classification neural network using PyTorch. The model classifies points generated in circles into two classes. It includes data generation, preprocessing, model construction, training, and evaluation.

## Features
- Generates synthetic circle data with noise.
- Utilizes PyTorch for building and training a neural network model.
- Implements a custom training loop with evaluation metrics.
- Provides visualization of data and model predictions.

## Usage
1. Open the `Pytorch_binary_classification_.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run each cell sequentially to execute the code blocks.
3. View training progress and evaluation metrics displayed during training.
4. Evaluate the trained model on the test set.

## Files
- `Pytorch_binary_classification_.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the project implementation.

## Requirements
- Python 3.11.5
- PyTorch
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- matplotlib
